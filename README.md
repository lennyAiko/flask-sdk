Treblle is a lightweight SDK that helps Engineering and Product teams build, ship & maintain REST based APIs faster.

## How Treblle Works

Once you’ve integrated a Treblle SDK in your codebase, this SDK will send requests and response data to your Treblle Dashboard.

In your Treblle Dashboard you get to see real-time requests to your API, auto-generated API docs, API analytics like how fast the response was for an endpoint, the load size of the response, etc.

Treblle also uses the requests sent to your Dashboard to calculate your API score which is a quality score that’s calculated based on the performance, quality, and security best practices for your API.

> Visit [https://docs.treblle.com](http://docs.treblle.com) for the complete documentation.

## Security

### Masking fields

Masking fields ensure certain sensitive data are removed before being sent to Treblle.

To make sure masking is done before any data leaves your server [we built it into all our SDKs](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#fields-masked-by-default).

This means data masking is super fast and happens on a programming level before the API request is sent to Treblle. You can [customize](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields#custom-masked-fields) exactly which fields are masked when you’re integrating the SDK.

> Visit the [Masked fields](https://docs.treblle.com/en/security/masked-fields) section of the [docs](https://docs.sailscasts.com) for the complete documentation.

## Get Started

1. Sign in to [Treblle](https://app.treblle.com).
2. [Create a Treblle project](https://docs.treblle.com/en/dashboard/projects#creating-a-project).
3. [Setup the SDK](#install-the-SDK) for your platform.

### Install the SDK

<!-- Installation instruction for the platform goes here -->

Install the necessary packages

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Setup

A `treblle.json` file has to be present in the root directory of the project. This file should contain a dictionary like the example below:

```
{
    "TREBLLE_API_KEY": "API key goes here",
    "TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID": "Project ID goes here",
    "TREBLLE_HIDDEN_KEYS": ["hidden", "keys", "goes", "here"]
}
```

> Don't forget to add `treblle.json` to .gitignore file

Once that is out of the way, the next step is to import the Treblle class and pass the `app` instance:

```py
from treblle-flask import Treblle
...
Treblle(app)
...
```

That is all it takes to set up the Treblle-flask SDK.

### Run the server

Two ways to run the server:

1. `flask --app main run`

To run in debug mode:

2. `flask --app main --debug run`

### Test files

There are also test files available, to run tests:

1. `cd treblle_flask`
2. `cd test`
3. run: `pytest` or `pytest -v` (to view test cases)

> Tip: Ensure treblle.json is present in project directory and test directory (just for testing purpose, don't forget to add to .gitignore) ;-)
